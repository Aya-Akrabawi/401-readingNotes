## Implementation: Linked Lists

**Linked List Data Structure**


Recent Articles on Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

**Linked List vs Array**

Both Arrays and Linked List can be used to store linear data of similar types, but they both have some advantages and disadvantages over each other. 


Above is a brief about what is linked list, so try to fill in the blanks to know more about it:

1- ______ ______ ____ means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.


2- ______ ______ ____ items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.


3- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use _______ in our machines. 


4- a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to ________ and _______ most elements, but can be very slow to ________.


answers: 
1- linear data structures
2- non-linear data structures
3- memory 
4- adding , removing , search
