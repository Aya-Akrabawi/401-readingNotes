**Stack**
A stack is a type of data structure that is linear where order is conserved. For many people, stack is known to have a LIFO (Last In First Out) mechanism. Let’s take a look at an example of a stack in real life: stack of plates.

**Common terminology for a stack is**

- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack, you will receive a NullReferenceException
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the top Node in the stack. FILO First In Last Out

**Queue**
Similar to a stack, queue is a linear data structure where it obeys the FIFO (First In First Out) mechanism. You can think of a queue as a single line of people at a fast food restaurants.

**Common terminology for a queue is**
Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.
Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek - When you peek you will view the top Node in the queue. If the queue is empty, and you don’t peek, you will receive a NullReferenceException.
