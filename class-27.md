**Components**

split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

**Stateful and Stateless Components**

Stateful and stateless components have many different names.

They are also known as:

* Container vs Presentational components

* Smart vs Dumb components

The literal difference is that one has state, and the other doesnâ€™t. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.

**React life cycles**

**Mounting**

* componentWillMount
* render
* componentDidMount
**Updating**

* componentWillReceiveProps
* shouldComponentUpdate
* componentWillUpdate
* render
* componentDidUpdate
**Unmounting**

* componentWillUnmount

## Review:

* Does a deployed React application require a server?
No

* Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

because it allows us to easily refactor code going forward.

* What does ```npm run build do```?

does nothing unless you specify what "build" does in your package.json file. It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.
