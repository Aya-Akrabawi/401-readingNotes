**What is ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)**
![](https://www.dnsstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/role-based-access-control.jpg)
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.


**Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:**

* Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
* Management role group – you can add and remove members.
* Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
* Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.


**BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC:**
* Current Status: Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security.
* Current Roles: Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion.
* Write a Policy: Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see.
* Make Changes: Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
Continually Adapt: It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking.
