**Graphs**
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

**Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:**
**Vertex** - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

**Edge** - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
**Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
**Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

**Graphs Vs Trees**
In graphs, there are no rules dictating the connection among the nodes. A graph contains a set of nodes and a set of edges but these edges can connect nodes in any possible way. Trees are actually a subset of graphs.
